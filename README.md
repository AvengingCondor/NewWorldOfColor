New World Of Color

This mod adds 16 new dye colors to the game! Dyes are compatible with all vanilla use cases and
make an effort to be as vanilla-friendly as possible. All recipes should unlock in the recipe
book when you collect the needed ingredients.

* Banners
* Dying leather/wolf armor
* Dying pet collars
* Fireworks
* Llama carpets

Vanilla Tweaks:
--------------------------
The mod makes a very small number of tweaks to vanilla recipes/textures, all of which can be easily undone/overrided with a resource pack if needed:
* Lime Dye had its recipe changed to not overlap with Olive, which had no other logical recipe
  * Lime Dye is now made with: Green + Yellow dye
* Light Blue dye had its recipe changed to make room for Azure as a step between it and normal blue
  * Light Blue Dye is now made with: Azure + White dye
* The Azure Bluet texture was updated to give the flowers a noticeable blue color(without straying too far from vanilla, it's still subtle), and they now craft into Azure dye instead of Light Gray
  * (The real life flowers are in fact most often blue, hence azure being in the name, so I honestly don't know why they didn't already reflect that and give light blue dye in vanilla)
* The Torchflower texture was updated to further emphasis the reddish-purple elements to make the burgundy dye connection clearer
